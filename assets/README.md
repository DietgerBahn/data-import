Update asset properties
========================

A simple utility to load a CSV file with asset information into the QRadar asset model based on IP address (which must exist in QRadar). 
The first column of the first line of the file must be 'ipaddress'.
The remaining columns of the file must contain field name headers that match the asset properties being loaded.
The asset with the most recent occurrence of the ip address is updated with the remaining fields on the line.

example:

ipaddress,Technical Owner,Location,Description

172.16.129.128,Chris Meenan,UK,Email Server

172.16.129.129,Joe Blogs,Altanta,Customer Database Server

172.16.129.130,Jason Corbin,Boston,Application Server
